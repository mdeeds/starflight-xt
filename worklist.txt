* Put RenderCanvas at the top of the hierarchy
  current: RotatingFrame -> SvgObject -> RenderCanvas
  should be: RenderCanvas -> RotatingFrame -> SvgObject

* No nested groups in SVG.  Just a single transform
  * Each object needs a pointer to its own group
  * Find a way to push transforms down and have the objects update accordingly
    Maybe a frame can have a SetDisplayMatrix method and it pushes through to the
    children.  The children are the ones that actually modify the XML
* Add 'mass' to rocket.svg metadata
